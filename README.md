This is an open solution to the [Home Credit Default Risk challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk).

## The purpose of the Open Solution
We are building entirely open solution to this competition. Specifically:
1. Check **live preview of our work** on public projects page: [Home Credit Default Risk](https://app.neptune.ml/neptune-ml/Home-Credit-Default-Risk).
1. Source code and [issues](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-home-credit/issues) are publicly available.

Rules are simple:
1. Clean code and extensible solution leads to the reproducible experimentations and better control over the improvements.
1. Open solution should establish solid benchmark and give good base for your custom ideas and experiments.

## Disclaimer
In this open source solution you will find references to the neptune.ml. It is free platform for community Users, which we use daily to keep track of our experiments. Please note that using neptune.ml is not necessary to proceed with this solution. You may run it as plain Python script :wink:.

## Installation
### Fast Track
1. Clone repository and install requirements (check _requirements.txt_)
1. Run experiment based on [LightGBM and random search](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-home-credit/wiki/LightGBM-and-basic-features):
```bash
python main.py train_evaluate_predict --pipeline_name lightGBM
```

### Step by step
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone --branch solution-3 https://github.com/robbiefrost/open-solution-home-credit
```
2. Install requirements in your Python3.5 environment
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
4. Update data directories in the [neptune.yaml](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-home-credit/blob/master/neptune.yaml) configuration file
5. Run experiment based on [LightGBM and random search](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-home-credit/wiki/LightGBM-and-basic-features):
```bash
python main.py train_evaluate_predict --pipeline_name lightGBM
```
6. collect submit from `experiment_directory` specified in the [neptune.yaml](https://github.com/minerva-ml/open-solution-home-credit/blob/master/neptune.yaml)
